    <description>A handful of useful extensions to the Should Assertion Library for testing different type and enumerables of those type for equality. Like the Should extensions themselves, these extensions provide assertions only, and therefore are also test runner agnostic.  I've been using these extensions in projects for several years and thought they would be useful for others.</description>
